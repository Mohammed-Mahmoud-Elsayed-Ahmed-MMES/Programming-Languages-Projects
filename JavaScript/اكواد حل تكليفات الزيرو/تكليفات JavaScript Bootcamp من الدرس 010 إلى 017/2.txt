// The innerHTML property in JavaScript is used to get or set the HTML or XML markup contained within an element. To insert the HTML into the document rather than replace the contents of an element, use the method insertAdjacentHTML().

The innerHTML property can be used to examine the current HTML source of the page, including any changes that have been made since the page was initially loaded.
